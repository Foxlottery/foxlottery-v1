# Overview
CryptoLottery is a decentralized lottery using crypto assets and smart contracts.
ERC20 tokens collected from users are distributed to random winners.
When users send money to the lottery, they can choose where to donate it, and a portion of the lottery proceeds are used for non-profit causes determined by a vote.

While regular lotteries offer a return rate of about 50%, the
CryptoLottery will return 75% to users, 5% to affiliate users, and the remaining 15% to revenue and 5% to non-profit expenses.

Lottery proceeds will be used for the following
- Operated by DeFi
- PR activities
- Development funds
- Building an ecosystem
- Dividends to staking wallets

CryptoLottery's organization will work towards becoming a fully DAO (self-sustaining decentralized organization).

# Vision
Decentralized lotteries improve society

# Challenges of centralized lotteries
- Lack of transparency.
- Low distribution rate.
- A portion of profits is used for social contributions, but where to donate is centrally determined.
- The amount of money spent on sales promotion is high.
- Paper lottery is not good for the environment.
- When you win a prize, you have to go to the bank to pick it up.

# Solutions and functions to solve the problems
- Transparent determination of winners
- High distribution rate
- Affiliates reduce promotion costs
- Vote on where to donate proceeds when purchasing lottery tickets
- DAO-ization
- Winnings are automatically transferred to your wallet when you win.

## Transparent winner determination
Since random numbers are generated on the blockchain, winners can be determined transparently.

## High distribution rate

Advantages of decentralized lotteries
- Low operating costs
- Affiliate functionality keeps promotional costs low.
- Winning money is high.
- Social contribution expenses are high, and the recipients of the funds are determined by the votes cast.

Disadvantages of a centralized lottery
- A high percentage of the headquarters' revenues.
- Printed on paper, which is expensive to print and bad for the environment.
- Social contribution PR expenses are low, and the recipients of the funds are centrally determined.
- The amount of winning money is small.

This is an example of a Japanese lottery.

## Reduce promotional costs with affiliates
Affiliates can refer users to CrytoLottery and receive a sales commission when users buy lottery tickets.

Affiliates need to stake a certain amount of CryptoLottery's ERC20 tokens to participate.
5% of the amount of lottery tickets purchased is paid to the affiliate as an affiliate commission. If not through an affiliate, the funds are paid to the CryptoLottery management.
Therefore, lottery participants pay the same amount of money whether they participate through an affiliate or directly from the CryptoLottery management website.

## Vote for where to donate the proceeds when you buy your lottery ticket
When purchasing lottery tickets, users select the SDG goals they want to achieve
For each goal, select an organization that is active in that area.

After the lottery is over, a portion of the proceeds will be immediately remitted to the organization determined by the vote.
This speedy approach to philanthropy makes society more peaceful and prosperous.

Charitable organizations can apply to CryptoLottery to put their profile and wallet address on the donation list.

## DAO-ized
Governance token holders set the policy for the application.
The owner organization handles marketing activities and development.
Staking will receive a portion of the proceeds.

## If you win, the money is automatically transferred to your wallet.
In the case of Japanese lotteries, a high ticket winner must bring his/her ID to the bank on a weekday at noon.
With blockchain, the money is automatically transferred to your wallet when you win and can be used on the same day.

Some foreign lotteries are forfeited if you do not pick up your lottery ticket within 7 days of the winning date.
By having the money sent automatically, you will not forget to get it.

# Ecosystem
We're going to turn this ecosystem around.
Social Action, DeFi, Lottery, Contribution to the Blockchain Network

## Operate with DeFi using funds spent on lottery
If there is a weekly lottery, set the odds of winning slightly higher if deposited in the lottery on the first day of the week. Allow more funds to be collected on the first day of the week.
The collected ERC20 tokens will be invested in uniswap or other means to generate income.

# How to use the lottery participants
You can purchase CryptoLottery tokens on exchanges or DeFi and
There are daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly CryptoLottery smart contracts, so you can deposit funds into the one you want.
Once you have deposited your funds, you can check to see how likely you are to win.
When the day of the winners...

# Lottery laws in each country

## Lottery laws in major developed countries
### Japan
The issuance of lottery tickets for sale by ordinary individuals or companies is prohibited under Article 187 of the Penal Code.
Lottery tickets can be sold by the national prefectures and 20 designated cities, i.e., local governments, as stipulated in the Lottery Law "Lottery Prize Certificate Law" (enacted in 1948). These local governments are authorized by the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications to act as ticket sellers and outsource ticket sales and other operations to banks and other financial institutions.

### U.S.A.
As in Japan, lotteries issued by local governments are permitted.

### Dubai
Although prohibited for religious reasons, there are some government-issued lotteries.
The Multi Millionaire lottery is sold at the Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, where the winner receives $1 million and other prizes such as cars and motorcycles are given away.

## About Lottery Smart Contracts
The lottery is conducted using an ERC20 token called CryptoLottery.

The smart contract to run the lottery is based on `TimedRandomSendContract`.
https://github.com/PeterTakahashi/CryptoLottery/blob/main/contracts/TimedRandomSendContract.sol


```js
name // name of the lottery (e.g., WeeklyLottery)
symbol // short name of the lottery (e.g., WLT)

// 1 day is 86400 seconds, so 1 week is 86400 * 7
cycle // Lottery cycle uinxtime (e.g. 86400 * 7)

closeTimestamp // Lottery closing time unixtime (e.g. block.timestamp + 86400 * 7)

erc20 // ERC20 token used in the lottery

randomSendingRules // how many people have what percentage chance of winning

// How much money to send to which address at the time of the lottery's closing date
// Mainly the address of the management headquarters, etc.
